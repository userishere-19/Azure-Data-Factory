## üìò Dynamic Copy of Multiple Azure SQL Database Tables to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Welcome to **Dynamic Azure Data Factory Integration**! This project demonstrates how to use Azure Data Factory to **dynamically extract and copy multiple tables from an Azure SQL Database** into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2). The solution is metadata-driven and does **not require hardcoding of table names** ‚Äî making it highly scalable and maintainable across large databases.

## üìå Project Goals

- Automatically identify and extract table metadata (names and schema) from the Azure SQL database.
- Leverage ADF‚Äôs Lookup and ForEach activities to drive dynamic data movement.
- Copy each table‚Äôs data into a structured ADLS Gen2 location using parameterized datasets and linked services.

...

## üßæ Metadata Table Example

The following SQL query is used to extract the table metadata from Azure SQL DB:

```sql
SELECT 
    QUOTENAME(t.name) AS tableName, 
    QUOTENAME(SCHEMA_NAME(t.schema_id)) AS schemaName 
FROM 
    sys.tables AS t

---

Sample Output:
tableName	schemaName
[Customer]	[SalesLT]
[Product]	[SalesLT]
[ErrorLog]	[dbo]
[Address]	[SalesLT]

This metadata feeds into the Lookup activity in the pipeline, which then drives the ForEach loop to copy data table-by-table.

‚öôÔ∏è Pipeline Structure
Lookup Activity ‚Äì Fetches the table and schema names dynamically.

ForEach Activity ‚Äì Iterates over the metadata list.

Copy Data Activity ‚Äì Performs the actual data copy from SQL DB to ADLS Gen2.v
